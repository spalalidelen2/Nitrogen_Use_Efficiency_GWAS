The repository contains information about the research study "Dissecting the genetic architecture of yield-related traits under different nitrogen conditions in maize".

# Objectives
1. Characterize the genetic variation in phenotypic response to different Nitrogen (N) conditions,
2. Carry out a genome-wide study to identify the genes associated with the N response,
3. Determine the genetic parameters such as mode of selection, polygenicity to understand maize domestication process under different N conditions.

# Major Findings
1. We identified that the traits are more heritable under HN conditions compared to LN conditions
2. We employed GWAS (genome-wide association study) using approximately 21 million SNPs and identified 231 and 139 trait-associated loci (TALs) under HN and LN conditions respectively, and 162 TALs for NR traits from a highly diverse population that have generated relatively robust QTL information
3. We applied a quantitative genetics approach and found that many of nitrogen responsive traits demonstrated negative selection causing to purge deleterious alleles in the maize genome
