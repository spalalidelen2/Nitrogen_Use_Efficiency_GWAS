The repository contains information about the research study "Dissecting the genetic architecture of yield-related traits under different nitrogen conditions in maize".

# Objectives
1. characterize genetic variation in phenotypic response to different Nitrogen (N) conditions,
2. carry out a genome-wide study to identify the genes associated with the N response,
3. determine the genetic parameters such as mode of selection, polygenicity to understand maize domestication process under different N conditions.
